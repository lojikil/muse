# Overview

- Muse: the simple Org-mode/Emacs-muse format I use for posting things on [Lojikil](http://lojikil.com)
- Anaxagoras: an old notes system I used to use, but would like to expand.

Anaxagoras bitrotted for a time, since I was working on another website management system that could handle
notes, but ended up not liking that one as much do to it being somewhat complicated. So, instead, I decided
to hack up Muse, and reboot Anaxagoras (which, let us be honest, is an awesome name)
